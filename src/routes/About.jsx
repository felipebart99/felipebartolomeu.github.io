    <p>I started my academic career in the Computer Science course in 2021. During this period, I had the opportunity to develop several projects with the aim of consolidating the knowledge acquired. I carried out projects to create Landing Pages, task lists, registration screens, websites using React.JS, among others. I am currently developing a challenging web application that displays temperature and humidity information collected through DHT sensors. This project involves creating the display screen, storing it in a database via AWS and programming the sensors and raspberry pi in Python and C.
    <br/>I am recognized for my sociability and tranquility, as well as my ability to assimilate new content with ease. I can say with conviction that my top 5 Soft Skills are emotional intelligence, Communication, teamwork, punctuality and ethical principles.</p>
